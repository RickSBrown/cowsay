# Commandline Wrappers

Instead of typing `java -jar cowjay.jar "Hello"` you want to type `cowsay "Hello"`.

The wrappers here enable this.


You need to download these scripts to a directory on your computer and add that directory to your [PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)).

You can download all four of them regardless of platform (windows, linux or mac).

You will also need to download the executable cowsay jar as described on the main page and put it in the same directory as the wrappers.

The wrappers themselves contain more instructions.
